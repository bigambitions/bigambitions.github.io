<p>January 4th, 2015</p>

<p>By using Big Ambitions Foundation website you are agreeing to be bound by the following terms and conditions here:</p>

<p>Here’s the basic idea:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t violate anyone&rsquo;s intellectual property and post anyone else&rsquo;s copyrighted or confidential material you don&rsquo;t have permission to use.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t post anything vulgar, inflammatory, pornographic, etc.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t post spam.</li>
<li>Too many metalinks and tags are not accepted. If you try to boost your SEO, that&rsquo;s an abuse of the system.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t post just to sell something. Sure, talk up your project, but don&rsquo;t mention how to buy it every single time.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t launch into personal attacks. You&rsquo;re not going to agree with everyone, but name-calling will just cause trouble and will be regarded as flaming behavior.</li>
<li>Tone down the foul language. You can say what you need to say without relying on cursing. In fact, your writing will be regarded as that much more creative.</li>
</ul>
