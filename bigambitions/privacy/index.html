<p>Effective Date: January 4, 2016</p>

<p>The Big Ambitions Foundation is committed to protecting the privacy of the site users. Big Ambitions Foundation intends to give users as much control as possible over user’s personally identifiable information, including registration data. This Privacy Statement applies to the &ldquo;bigambitions.org&rdquo; site and describes the information Big Ambitions Foundation collects about users and how that information may be used. This privacy policy also governs the use of information obtained by the Big Ambitions Foundation by its Founding Members / Sponsors.</p>

<p>Big Ambitions Foundation reserves the right to update and change this Privacy Statement from time to time. Big Ambitions reserves the right to change or update the Privacy Policy at any time without any prior notification to any person. The changed or updated privacy policy will be available here. Your continued use of our services even after the updated Privacy Policy on this page will constitute your acknowledgment of the modifications and your consent to abide and be bound by the modified / updated Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3 id="notice:18d05a63a1c8d7ed973cc51838494e41">NOTICE</h3>

Big Ambitions Foundation is not yet registered as an organisation or company in any country, once registered, we&rsquo;ll update our Privacy Policy but we can&rsquo;t promise to send individual notifications to the already registered users.</p>

<h3 id="children:18d05a63a1c8d7ed973cc51838494e41">Children</h3>

The Sites are not directed to children under the age of 13, and Big Ambitions Foundation will never request personally identifiable information from anyone whom it knows to be under the age of 13 without verifiable parental or guardian consent. Big Ambitions Foundation does not knowingly collect, or wish to obtain, personally identifiable information from children.

<h3 id="what-information-big-ambitions-foundation-collects:18d05a63a1c8d7ed973cc51838494e41">What information Big Ambitions Foundation collects</h3>

<p>Big Ambitions Foundation may collect two types of information from users of Sites: &ldquo;personally identifiable information&rdquo; (such as name, email address, postal address, telephone, birth date, geographical location) and &ldquo;aggregate information&rdquo; (such as frequency of visits to Sites, IP address, Site pages accessed, browser type). Personally identifiable information is any piece of information which can potentially be used to uniquely identify, contact, or locate a user of the Sites. Aggregate information is non-personally identifiable/anonymous information about users of the Sites. Aggregate information is used in a collective manner and no single person can be identified by that compiled information.</p>

<p>However, if you provide personally identifiable information, it may also be linked with information that would otherwise be aggregate information. For example, the Sites may log your IP address, pages you have accessed, or links you click on, and store that information in connection your personally identifiable information. This is done to understand how you use the site, to assist in making the site function and in some cases it may be used to track how you arrived at one of the Sites, such as codes from affiliates that route traffic to the site.</p>

<p>On the Sites, users may order products or services, and register to receive materials. Personally identifiable information collected on the Sites includes community forum content, diaries, profiles, photographs, name, unique identifiers (e.g., passwords), contact and billing information (e.g., email address, postal address, telephone, fax), and transaction information. Sites may also collect your actual location by methods such as IP address, GPS, or other sensors in your device that share location information.</p>

<p>In order to tailor Big Ambitions Foundation’s subsequent communications to users and continuously improve the Sites’ products and services, Big Ambitions Foundation may also ask users to provide information regarding their interests, demographics, experience with its products, and detailed contact preferences.</p>

<h3 id="cookies:18d05a63a1c8d7ed973cc51838494e41">Cookies</h3>

A cookie is a unique text file that may be used for data analysis, and enables a web site to tailor information presented to a user based on a user’s browsing program.

In the course of serving advertisements to the Sites, Advertisers may place or recognize a unique cookie on a user’s browser. The Big Ambitions Foundation may provide Information about users’ visits to the Sites to Advertisers, such as the number of times users have viewed or clicked on an ad (but no users’ names, addresses, or other personally identifiable information), are used to serve ads to visitors.
