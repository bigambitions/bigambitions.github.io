&lt;p&gt;Effective Date: January 4, 2016&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Big Ambitions Foundation is committed to protecting the privacy of the site users. Big Ambitions Foundation intends to give users as much control as possible over user’s personally identifiable information, including registration data. This Privacy Statement applies to the &amp;ldquo;bigambitions.org&amp;rdquo; site and describes the information Big Ambitions Foundation collects about users and how that information may be used. This privacy policy also governs the use of information obtained by the Big Ambitions Foundation by its Founding Members / Sponsors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big Ambitions Foundation reserves the right to update and change this Privacy Statement from time to time. Big Ambitions reserves the right to change or update the Privacy Policy at any time without any prior notification to any person. The changed or updated privacy policy will be available here. Your continued use of our services even after the updated Privacy Policy on this page will constitute your acknowledgment of the modifications and your consent to abide and be bound by the modified / updated Privacy Policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;notice:18d05a63a1c8d7ed973cc51838494e41&#34;&gt;NOTICE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big Ambitions Foundation provides this Privacy Policy Statement to make users aware of Big Ambitions Foundation privacy practices, and of the choices a user may make about the way the user’s information is collected and used. Big Ambitions Foundation is not yet registered as an organisation or company in any country, once registered, we&amp;rsquo;ll update our Privacy Policy but we can&amp;rsquo;t promise to send individual notifications to the already registered users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;children:18d05a63a1c8d7ed973cc51838494e41&#34;&gt;Children&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users represent they are of legal age to create binding and financial obligations for any liability users may incur as a result of their use of the Sites. The Sites are not directed to children under the age of 13, and Big Ambitions Foundation will never request personally identifiable information from anyone whom it knows to be under the age of 13 without verifiable parental or guardian consent. Big Ambitions Foundation does not knowingly collect, or wish to obtain, personally identifiable information from children. If Big Ambitions Foundation becomes aware that a user is under the age of 13 and has provided personally identifiable information without prior verifiable parental or guardian consent, it will remove user’s personally identifiable information from its files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-information-big-ambitions-foundation-collects:18d05a63a1c8d7ed973cc51838494e41&#34;&gt;What information Big Ambitions Foundation collects&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big Ambitions Foundation may collect two types of information from users of Sites: &amp;ldquo;personally identifiable information&amp;rdquo; (such as name, email address, postal address, telephone, birth date, geographical location) and &amp;ldquo;aggregate information&amp;rdquo; (such as frequency of visits to Sites, IP address, Site pages accessed, browser type). Personally identifiable information is any piece of information which can potentially be used to uniquely identify, contact, or locate a user of the Sites. Aggregate information is non-personally identifiable/anonymous information about users of the Sites. Aggregate information is used in a collective manner and no single person can be identified by that compiled information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you provide personally identifiable information, it may also be linked with information that would otherwise be aggregate information. For example, the Sites may log your IP address, pages you have accessed, or links you click on, and store that information in connection your personally identifiable information. This is done to understand how you use the site, to assist in making the site function and in some cases it may be used to track how you arrived at one of the Sites, such as codes from affiliates that route traffic to the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Sites, users may order products or services, and register to receive materials. Personally identifiable information collected on the Sites includes community forum content, diaries, profiles, photographs, name, unique identifiers (e.g., passwords), contact and billing information (e.g., email address, postal address, telephone, fax), and transaction information. Sites may also collect your actual location by methods such as IP address, GPS, or other sensors in your device that share location information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to tailor Big Ambitions Foundation’s subsequent communications to users and continuously improve the Sites’ products and services, Big Ambitions Foundation may also ask users to provide information regarding their interests, demographics, experience with its products, and detailed contact preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;cookies:18d05a63a1c8d7ed973cc51838494e41&#34;&gt;Cookies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big Ambitions Foundation uses cookies on the Sites. A cookie is a unique text file that may be used for data analysis, and enables a web site to tailor information presented to a user based on a user’s browsing program. Big Ambitions Foundation may use cookies to personalize a user’s pages at a Site, to remember a user when the user registers for products or services, or to track visits to a Site. If a user does not want Big Ambitions Foundation to deploy cookies in the user’s browser, the user may set the browser to reject cookies or to notify the user when a web site tries to place cookies in the browser program. Rejecting cookies may affect a user’s ability to use some of the products, features, functions, or services on a Site. Cookies do not contain personally identifiable information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ads appearing on the Sites are delivered to visitors by Big Ambitions Foundation, and third party web advertising partners  (&amp;ldquo;Advertisers&amp;rdquo;). The third party advertising technology that Big Ambitions Foundation uses on the Sites uses information derived from a user’s visits to the Sites to target advertising within the Sites. In addition, Big Ambitions Foundation’s advertisers may use other third party advertising technology to target advertising on the Sites. In the course of serving advertisements to the Sites, Advertisers may place or recognize a unique cookie on a user’s browser. The Big Ambitions Foundation may provide Information about users’ visits to the Sites to Advertisers, such as the number of times users have viewed or clicked on an ad (but no users’ names, addresses, or other personally identifiable information), are used to serve ads to visitors. It is also possible that the Advertisers will use information gathered from your visits to other third-party websites (i.e., not under the control of the Big Ambitions Foundation) that also use the Advertisers’ services, which could potentially including personally identifiable information you provided to those third parties, in choosing what advertisements to show. Any information provided by you to the Advertisers via third-party websites would be governed by the privacy policy of those third-party websites. As with other cookies, and consistent with Big Ambitions Foundation’s policy on cookies stated above, the user may use third party browser plugins or extensions to direct their web browser to block or delete such cookies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;log-files:18d05a63a1c8d7ed973cc51838494e41&#34;&gt;Log files&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big Ambitions Foundation web servers may automatically log aggregate information, such as a user’s IP address, domain name, browser type, date and time of access, and other log file data. This information may be used to analyze trends or administer the Sites. Log files do not contain personally identifiable information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-big-ambitions-foundation-uses-the-information-collected:18d05a63a1c8d7ed973cc51838494e41&#34;&gt;How Big Ambitions Foundation uses the information collected&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big Ambitions Foundation may use the personally identifiable information a user submits for any purposes related to Big Ambitions Foundation&amp;rsquo;s business, including, but not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To understand a user’s needs and create content that is relevant to the user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To generate statistical studies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To conduct market research and planning by sending user surveys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To notify user referrals of Big Ambitions Foundation services, information, or products when a user requests that Big Ambitions Foundation send such information to referrals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To improve services, information, and products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To help a user complete a transaction, or provide services or customer support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To communicate back to the user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To update the user on services, information, and products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To personalize a Site for the user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To notify the user of any changes with a Site which may affect the user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To enforce terms of use on a Site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To allow the user to purchase products, access services, or otherwise engage in activities the user selects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;User names, identifications (&amp;ldquo;IDs&amp;rdquo;), and email addresses (as well as any additional information that a user may choose to post) may be publicly available on a Site when users voluntarily and publicly disclose personally identifiable information, such as when a user posts personally identifiable information in conjunction with content subject to an Open Source license, or as part of a message posted to a public forum or a publicly-released software application. Users may not be able to change or remove public postings once posted. Such personally identifiable information may be used by visitors of these pages to send unsolicited messages. Big Ambitions Foundation is not responsible for any consequences which may occur from the use of personally identifiable information that a user chooses to submit to public pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With respect to surveys, in the event that responses are publicly disclosed, users will be notified at the time they take the survey. Big Ambitions Foundation will disclose only aggregate information regarding its users, which as stated earlier is anonymous information that does not identify any specific individual. Circumstances under which Big Ambitions Foundation would publicly disclose such aggregate information include, but are not limited to, sharing survey results with the site population, providing data to Big Ambitions Foundation advertisers on user preferences and/or demographics, and publicizing overall usage data in press communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where surveys allow users to submit written comments, and where Big Ambitions Foundation advises users of the possibility of such disclosure at the time they take the survey, Big Ambitions Foundation reserves the right to disclose any information provided by users, provided that no personal information identifying a specific user is disclosed. Participation in surveys is at a user&amp;rsquo;s option; Big Ambitions Foundation does not conduct mandatory surveys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;choice-opt-out:18d05a63a1c8d7ed973cc51838494e41&#34;&gt;CHOICE/OPT OUT&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A user makes the decision whether to proceed with any activity that requests personally identifiable information. If a user does not provide requested information, the user may not be able to complete certain transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users who use the personally identifiable information of other users agree to use such information only for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using services offered through a Site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Site transaction-related purposes and not for unsolicited commercial messages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other purposes that the other user expressly chooses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users are not licensed to add other users to a Site, even users who entered into transactions with them, or to their mail lists without consent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big Ambitions Foundation encourages users to evaluate privacy and security policies of any of the Sites’ transaction partners before entering into transactions or choosing to disclose personally identifiable information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;emails:18d05a63a1c8d7ed973cc51838494e41&#34;&gt;Emails&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big Ambitions Foundation will not use or share the personally identifiable information provided to it online in ways unrelated to the items described above without first letting a user know and offering the user a choice except the email IDs and other personal information of the users can be shared with the Founding members / Sponsors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users may have the opportunity to use a service to send electronic mail to another user or email list. In such cases, a user&amp;rsquo;s valid email address and real name will be included with such messages. In order to prevent abuse, users may not opt out of such a display where possible, but may choose to refrain from using such service to transmit an email message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;photographs:18d05a63a1c8d7ed973cc51838494e41&#34;&gt;Photographs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users may have the opportunity to submit photographs to the Sites for product promotions, contests, and other purposes to be disclosed at the time of request. In these circumstances, the Sites are designed to allow the public to view, download, save, and otherwise access the photographs posted. By submitting a photograph, users waive any privacy expectations users have with respect to the security of such photographs, and Big Ambitions Foundation’s use or exploitation of users’ likeness.

&lt;p&gt;January 4th, 2015&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using Big Ambitions Foundation website you are agreeing to be bound by the following terms and conditions here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the basic idea:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t violate anyone&amp;rsquo;s intellectual property and post anyone else&amp;rsquo;s copyrighted or confidential material you don&amp;rsquo;t have permission to use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t post anything vulgar, inflammatory, pornographic, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t post spam.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Too many metalinks and tags are not accepted. If you try to boost your SEO, that&amp;rsquo;s an abuse of the system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t post just to sell something. Sure, talk up your project, but don&amp;rsquo;t mention how to buy it every single time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t launch into personal attacks. You&amp;rsquo;re not going to agree with everyone, but name-calling will just cause trouble and will be regarded as flaming behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tone down the foul language. You can say what you need to say without relying on cursing. In fact, your writing will be regarded as that much more creative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;big-ambitions-foundation-terms-of-use:65113e50d6220eea001cdd4f9fba4cc1&#34;&gt;Big Ambitions Foundation Terms of Use&lt;/h3&gt;
